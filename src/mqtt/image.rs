/// title: "MQTT Image"

///
/// The `mqtt` image platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as an image.
/// The `image` platform is a simplified version of the `camera` platform that only accepts images.
/// Every time a message under the `image_topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated. Messages received on `image_topic` should contain the full contents of an image file, for example, a JPEG image, without any additional encoding or metadata.
///
/// This can be used with an application or a service capable of sending images through MQTT.
///
/// An alternative setup is to use the `url_topic` option to receive an image URL for a new picture to show.
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// To enable this image in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:

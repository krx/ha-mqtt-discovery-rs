///
/// The `mqtt` siren platform lets you control your MQTT enabled sirens and text based notification devices.
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT siren will receive an instant state update after subscription, and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the siren will be `false` / `off`.
///
/// When a `state_topic` is not available, the siren will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the siren will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the siren will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).
///
/// Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect operation.
///
/// To enable this siren in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - siren:
///       command_topic: "home/bedroom/siren/set"
